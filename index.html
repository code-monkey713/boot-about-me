      About Me
    </header>
    <main>
      My name is Tony Tran. I'm currently enrolled in the Rice University Coding Boot Camp. I'm scheduled to complete the boot camp at the end of May 2021. I'm still deciding what fields of work I'm interested in working for. My experience is mostly in the Information Technology Business/IT Analyst. I'm the guy that can talk with the business units and the programmers and be the bridge between them.
