# Tony Tran - My Portfolio
This is the project for using Bootstrap to build my portfolio page to be ready for employement ready. 

## Description

We were taught with using Bootstrap for building a website from scratch using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap libraries. The page is compliance with accessibility standards. The page was designed with responsive design in mind built from mobile first design. 

This portfolio is currently work in progress as contents will be updated and added with my continued education with Rice University.
