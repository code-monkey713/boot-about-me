# Tony Tran - My Portfolio
This is my portfolio project that was initially built using Bootstrap. This portfolio will be updated to be using Zurb Foundation framework. 

## Description

We were taught with using Bootstrap for building a website from scratch using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap libraries. The page is compliance with accessibility standards. The page was designed with responsive design in mind built from mobile first design. 

This portfolio will be regularly updated with new contents as I progress with new skills.  

Here is a link to the deployed project.
